so after you have watched this video you can go back to your boss at jet_brains and tell him that there is something called c++ and PGO that we can use to make our IDEs much more faster and much more optimized if he and his tech_lead even know what optimazation is; and we can make use of c++ speed instead of the slow java; and make our lives and other programmers lives much better instead of givin them our useless IDEs and call it a day;


so after you have watched this video you can go back to your boss at unity and tell him that there is language called c++ that is far more advance and much more faster than c#; that can make the useless games that are made with our  engine well more optimized and faster; instead of making half of the games out there cpu hangry and making all the poor gamers mony go to intel and amd hands;


in this video i have no joke; the only joke that i have is for my self; so you never know that you are good in math until you face it; so if you are a unity programmer you can go back to watch your unity tutorials, and i can go back to watch tzuyu and yiren fancams,
and we can bouth learn prety much nothing;
